# Publisher Theme Preferences

This is a small plugin which ensures journals are using the theme set by their publisher.

This does two main things:

* When opening the admin overview, ensuring all journals are using the right theme including activiating any theme plugins to ensure they work
  correctly
* Hiding the choice from journal administrators to change their journal, but still able to change any options provided by the theme for their
  journal
